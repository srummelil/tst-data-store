# tst-data-store

Hello! 

I work in data science, esp. Python, and am creating this more-useful-than-hello-world test repo.

I work with a TON of text data, and loading / unloading is a pain, so am creating code to accept an arbitrary file, see if it has already been processed, and if so, open the pickle version of it instead of re-parsing.

This may be a bad idea, but it is a useful exercise in learning Python file handling, pickle, etc.

Comments and suggestions welcome.

This is my initial commit.
